# simplefish
A minimalistic, git-aware, and relatively fast prompt for fish shell

## Install 

Just place the file `fish_prompt.fish` inside the `~/.config/fish/functions` directory. 
For the prompt to work as advertised, you'll need git and the powerline fonts.

## Bugs and screenshot

I have never tried this prompt with anything other than a black background. It may look horrible on non-black backgrounds. I will never know.

A screenshot illustrating how the prompt changes with git status / errors / non-writable directories :

# simplefish
A minimalistic, git-aware, and relatively fast prompt for fish shell

## Install 

Just place the file `fish_prompt.fish` inside the `~/.config/fish/functions` directory. 
For the prompt to work as advertised, you'll need git and the powerline fonts.

I have never-ever tried this prompt with anything other that black background, it may look horrible.

A screenshot illustrating how the prompt changes with git / errors / non-writable directories, is this:
